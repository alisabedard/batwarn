# batwarn
Simple battery warning daemon using sysfs and X display gamma.  

This is a very lightweight daemon which notifies the user of low battery 
status by changing the X screen gamma.  Batwarn requires sysfs. Batwarn 
occupies very little memory and is suitable for inclusion in one's .xinitrc 
file.
